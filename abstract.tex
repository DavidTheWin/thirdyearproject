\begin{abstract}
This paper details the tool \textit{qbftoepr} that converts \glspl{qbf} to \gls{epr} through a process of Skolemization. This opens new techniques for solving \glspl{qbf} using automated theorem provers for first order logic such as iProver~\cite{korovin2008iprover} over traditional techniques for solving \glspl{qbf} such as (a variation of) the \gls{dpll} algorithm~\cite{davis1962machine}. Other techniques are discussed for improving the efficiency of conversion and reducing the complexity of the \gls{epr} result. In particular, an implementation of dependency schemes is detailed and the concept of anti-prenexing is outlined. The tool is evaluated against the traditional \gls{qbf} solver DepQBF~\cite{lonsing2010depqbf} to compare the efficiency of converting and solving to solving the \gls{qbf} directly. It is also evaluated against another tool called qbf2epr~\cite{seidl2012qbf2epr} that also converts \glspl{qbf} to \gls{epr} to compare it against a different implementation of the same conversion.\newline \newline
